# Library Management System
The Library Management System is designed to facilitate the management of a library's resources by providing a convenient interface for librarians and library users. The system allows admins to handle book catalogs, track lending and returns, and manage customer accounts. Users can explore available books, reserve and borrow books, and manage their profiles.
